		<h2>Styles Used In This Guide</h2>
		Code examples look like <pre>this</pre><br/>
		<pre>Longer code examples {
  Look like this.
}</pre><br/>
		Important concepts look like <h4>this</h4><br/>
		Important words will be in this <b>style</b><br/><br/>

		The tone of this set will be informal and conversational.
		It's not cool if this is you're first time programming and I hit you with a wall of technical terms.<br/>
		If you're viewing this as the split screen, the interactive javascript playground is on the right side.

		<h2>Actual Introduction</h2>
		Yay, we're finally going to start javascript.
		Javascript is made of <b>statements</b>. Each statement must end with a <b>semicolon</b><pre>;</pre><br/>
		<h4>Repeat, each statement MUST end with a semicolon;</h4><br/>
		Don't forget this, I'll be watching :)<br/>
		One more very important thing!<br/>
		<h4>Javascript is CASE-SENSITIVE</h4><br/>
		This means that <pre>foo</pre> is <b>NOT</b> the same as <pre>Foo</pre>.<br/>

		<h2>Functions</h2>
		Statements can do many things, one of these things is calling <b>functions</b>. I will introduce how to create functions later, but I will first teach you how to call functions.<br/><br/>
		Copy and paste the following statement into the text editor on the right.<br/>
		<pre>alert("Hello World");</pre><br/>
		Press <b>Run Script</b> and watch the magic!<br/><br/>
		
		Let's backtrack and see what happened there.
		<ul>
			<li><pre>alert(</pre> is the function name. The opening parentheses show that this is a function that you're calling.</li>
			<li><pre>"Hello World"</pre> is the argument to the function. This allows you to pass information/data into the function so that it can do something with that data. In this case, <pre>alert</pre> displays whatever you pass into it.</li>
			<li><pre>)</pre> closes up the function call.</li>
			<li><pre>;</pre> ends the statement.</li>
		</ul>
		Quick exercises
		<ul>
			<li>Try changing the function name. What happens? Is this what you expected?</li>
			<li>Try changing the argument (<pre>"Hello World"</pre>). What happens here?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Variables Introduction</h2>
		<pre>var</pre> declares a <b>variable</b>. It tells javascript that you want to use that name.<br/>
		This is an example of a valid declaration: <pre>var foo;</pre><br/>
		Now we can store stuff in it like this: <pre>foo = "hi";</pre><br/>
		You can now use that variable in places: <pre>alert(foo);</pre><br/>
		Paste those last 3 lines of code in and try it!<br/>
		(You can also combine declaring and setting a variable into one statement like this: <pre>var foo = "hi";</pre>)<br/><br/>
		
		You can see that whatever you set <pre>foo</pre> equal to gets displayed.<br/>
		I've you've been paying close attention, you'll notice that the text thats being shown has <b>quotes</b> around it.<br/>
		This is a special type of variable, its called a <h4>string</h4>.<br/>
		That's just a fancy way of saying <b>text</b>. The quotes are simply there to tell javascript that you are making a string.<br/>
		Without those, javascript would get confused and think you're trying to use a <b>variable</b>.<br/>
		<h4>This is a string: </h4><pre>"foo_bar"</pre><br/>
		<h4>This is a variable: </h4><pre>foo_bar</pre><br/><br/>

		Side note, <b>variable names</b> can be made of <b>letters, numbers, and underscores</b> but have to start with <b>letters or underscores</b>.<br/>
		<h4>The names cannot contain spaces</h4><br/>
		Valid variable name examples: <pre>foo,bar,_bar,foo_bar,dungeon6,stuff_6</pre><br/>
		Invalid variable name examples: <pre>235x,I hate spaces,#taco,@$^%$a5</pre><br/><br/>

		Quick exercises
		<ul>
			<li>Try putting quotes around <pre>foo</pre> in the <pre>alert</pre>. What happens? Can you explain why this happens?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>My box analogy</h2>
		You can think of each variable as a <b>box</b>.<br/>
		Because it's a box, it can hold many different kinds of stuff/data.<br/>
		Keep this in mind as we move on.<br/>
		I'm not sure where to put this, so I'm putting it here:<br/>
		<pre>+</pre> <h4>adds</h4> together two variables. Depending on what type they are determines how they will be added together.<br/>

		<h2>Data types</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Strings</b><br/>
				I briefly mentioned these earlier. You can think of these like words on a notecard. When you add together strings, they are added to the end of each other. It's like taping one notecard to the end of another.<br/>
				Strings always have either <h4>single quotes</h4> or <h4>double quotes</h4> around them!<br/>
				<pre>"This is a string"
'This_is_another_string'
This is not a string</pre><br/>
				<pre>4234</pre> <b>not a string</b><br/>
				<pre>"3234"</pre> <b> this is a string</b><br/>
				<h4>Even though the last one looks like a number, because it has double quotes, the last one IS A STRING</h4>
				
				Try this code segment:<br/>
				<pre>var foo = "Hello ";
var bar = "World!";
alert(foo + bar);</pre><br/>
				Notice how the strings are added.<br/>
				Try this one if you don't believe me on the number strings:<br/>
				<pre>var foo = "23";
var bar = "24";
alert(foo + bar);</pre><br/>
				We'll talk about adding real numbers next.<br/>
				
			</li>
			<li><b>Numbers</b><br/>
				Imagine these as a certian number of marbles. When you pour marbles from different boxes into one, you get the sum of the marbles.
				This is what happens when you add numbers. Numbers look like, well, numbers.<br/>
				All of these are numbers:<br/>
				<pre>345
786.21
-546.32543
-35
0
6.02E-23
3.00E8</pre><br/>
				The last two are scientific notation by the way.<br/>
				These are NOT numbers:<br/>
				<pre>2435x
324E
43.21.65</pre><br/>
				Adapt the previous examples to add numbers (From now on, I'm probably not going to put every example in, because this lesson is already getting long). <br/>
				Try doing other operations on the numbers (<pre>+ - * /</pre>).<br/>
				You can also use <b>parentheses</b> to group expressions, just like in math class!<br/>
				There's one more function I'd like you to try out:<br/>
				<pre>var x = Math.sqrt(10);
alert(x);</pre><br/>
				Can you guess what this does?<br/>
				You might need this later. Just sayin'.<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>Objects</b><br/>
				Images these as a box with dividers. They can hold many other variables and functions.<br/>
				We'll cover these in a later chapter.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Setting Variables</h2>
		You can set variables equal to something. The variable on the left is always being set. (assume I've declared all variables already)<br/>
		<pre>x = y * z;</pre><br/>
		This statement sets x equal to the result of y times z.<br/>
		<h4>The left side expression MUST be a single variable</h4><br/>
		For example, this expression will not work:<br/>
		<pre>x + t = y * z</pre><br/>
		This javascript, not your graphing calculator (Not saying I don't <i>want</i> those features :)<br/>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Mean calculator</b><br/>
				I'm assigning this cause I'm mean (har har har :) Your task is to write a program that calculates the mean of four numbers.<br/>
				I've started it here for you:<br/>
				<pre>var n1 = 2;
var n2 = 54;
var n3 = 23;
var n4 = 92;</pre><br/>
				Hoot like a pterodactyl when you're done so I know.<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>Distance calculator</b><br/>
				Your task is to calculate the distance between two ordered pairs.<br/>
				I've started it here:<br/>
				<pre>var x1 = 2;
var y1 = 23;
var x2 = 9;
var y2 = 1;</pre><br/>
				Make more creative animal sounds when you're done!<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>Sentance maker</b><br/>
				I've accidentally blown my sentances into fragments :) I need you to help me put them back together.<br/>
				<pre>var word1 = "You";
var word2 = "are";
var word3 = "very";
var word4 = "silly";</pre><br/>
				Display it as one sentance. Don't forget spaces or the period!
				Make robot sounds when you're done!<br/>
