		<h2>Styles Used In This Guide</h2>
		Code examples look like <pre>this</pre><br/>
		<pre>Longer code examples {
  Look like this.
}</pre><br/>
		Important concepts look like <h4>this</h4><br/>
		Important words will be in this <b>style</b><br/><br/>

		The tone of this set will be informal and conversational.
		It's cool if this is you're first time programming and I hit you with a wall of technical terms.<br/>
		If you're viewing this as the split screen, the interactive javascript playground is on the right side.

		<h2>Actual Introduction</h2>
		Yay, we're finally going to start javascript.
		Javascript is made of <b>statements</b>. Each statement must end with a <b>semicolon</b><pre>;</pre><br/>
		<h4>Repeat, each statement MUST end with a semicolon.</h4><br/><br/>

		Statements can do many things, one of these things is calling <b>functions</b>. I will introduce how to create functions later, but I will first teach you how to call functions.<br/><br/>
		Copy and paste the following statement into the text editor on the right.<br/>
		<pre>alert("Hello World");</pre><br/>
		Press <b>Run Script</b> and watch the magic!<br/><br/>
		
		Let's backtrack and see what happened there.
		<ul>
			<li><pre>alert(</pre> is the function name. The opening parentheses show that this is a function that you're calling.</li>
			<li><pre>"Hello World"</pre> is the argument to the function. This allows you to pass information/data into the function so that it can do something with that data. In this case, <pre>alert</pre> displays whatever you pass into it.</li>
			<li><pre>)</pre> closes up the function call.</li>
			<li><pre>;</pre> ends the statement.</li>
		</ul>
		Quick exercises
		<ul>
			<li>Try changing the function name. What happens? Is this what you expected?</li>
			<li>Try changing the argument (<pre>"Hello World"</pre>). What happens here?</li>
		</ul>
